# Product-Analysis

Problem Description:
You're working as a junior analyst for the TTWC consulting agency ("TripleTen World Consultancy"). This year, you're dealing with a particularly special client: AtliQ Hardware.
AtliQ Hardware is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India, and has even expanded into other countries as well. They sell different types of hardware to big players such as Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart. This year, they're asking PWC to conduct a big audit of their sales and help them automate their existing data.

Tasked with product analysis, which items are the bestsellers? How can the company improve its sales? How has popularity changed over time/across markets?
